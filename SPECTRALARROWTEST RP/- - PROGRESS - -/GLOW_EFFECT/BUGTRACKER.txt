BUG TRACKER TO RECORD ALL BUGS AND GLITCHES THAT HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE TIME OF MAKING THE TEXTURE PACK

	invertedCube_bug-render (RESOLVED)
		DESCRIPTION:
		- INCORRECTLY RENDERS INVERTED CUBES WITH ONLY THE TOP AND BOTTOM SIDES VISIBLE
		FIX:
		- UV FACES OF CUBE SHOULD BE INSIDE THE TEXTURE IMAGE. THE OUTLINE PLUGIN USUALLY PUTS THE UV FACES OUTSIDE THE TEXTURE
